You know that I'm a crazy bitch\nI do what I want, when I feel like it\nAll I wanna do is lose control\nBut you don't really give a shit\nYa go with it, go with it, go with it\n‘Cause you're fuckin' crazy\nRock n' roll.\n\nYou-ou said “hey\nWhat's your name?”\nIt took one look and\nNow I'm not the same.\n\nYeah, you said “Hey”\nAnd since that day,\nYou stole my heart and you're the one to blame\nYeah.\n\n[Chorus:]\nAnd that's why I smile\nIt's been a while\nSince everyday and everything has felt this right\nAnd now\nYou turn it all around\nAnd suddenly you're all I need\nThe reason why,\nI-i-i, I smi-i-i-ile.\n\n2. Last night I blacked out, I think.\nWhat did you, what did you put in my drink?\nI remember making out and then\nOh oh\nI Woke up with a new tattoo\nYour name was on me and my name was on you.\nI would do it all over again\n\nYou-ou said “hey (hey)\nWhat's your name?” (what's your name)\nIt took one look and\nNow I'm not the same.\n\nYeah, you said “Hey” (hey)\nAnd since that day, (since that day)\nYou stole my heart and you're the one to blame.\n\n[Bridge:]\nYou know that I'm a crazy bitch\nI do what I want, when I feel like it\nAll I wanna do is lose control\nYou know that I'm a crazy bitch\nI do what I want, when I feel like it\nAll I wanna do is lose control.",
